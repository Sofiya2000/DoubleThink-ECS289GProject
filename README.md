# DoubleThink-ECS289GProject

We have created a game called DoubleThink that is a playable interactive model to show the propagation of computational propaganda that is fake news or disinformation in a social network. As you can there is a graph displayed on the screen which represents a social network and each node to represents user accounts- which are in blue colour and bot or spam accounts accounts that are in orange colour, in a social network. The links in this social network represent the connectivity and how the social network is interconnected. If you take the example of Facebook, then links represent the number of friends, you have, and the mutual friends that you may have in a social network. The player can then choose how big they want their social network to be. Once the number of notes is chosen by the user, a random graph is generated as the social network and every time a different social network is generated.

As the user clicks on start propagation, the disinformation will start propagating from a randomly selected node which will be the seed or starting node. as you can see on the screen our model shows how the disinformation is propagating and the colour changes to red, which shows that these nodes have been infected by the disinformation and at the end of the simulation all the notes, most or majority of the notes will be displayed in red that is they are infected. This model basically makes the player aware of how computational propoganda or disinformation propagates in a social network. The main goal is to make the player aware of how fast a single user can influence an entire social network by playable and interactive means.

To run the app download the folder app-sofiya 2 and run the command npm install to install the necessary modules and start running the app using npm start. 
Our code for the backend is on the main branch and the front-end app is on the master branch. 
The web browser screen will give the below display when you run the app-sofiya 2 :
